Hristo Grozev provided with all the data he has about Navalniy's murders flights and train trips for several years here

I cleaned the data, translated to English, added extra data about flight and trains numbers and made a pivot to easy access. 
Now we can check for every date (if we have this data) where murder's team was. 
Enjoy.
